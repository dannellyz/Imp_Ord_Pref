Given a set of preferences for one side of the market (does not need to be complete[complete means having preferences for all possibilities]), replace a certain proportion of known preferences with an ``unknown'' indicator (obviously have to work bottom up because if someone ranks their top 5 and their 7th, then they would know their 6th)[leaving the idea of knowing most and least preferred but not middle preferred for future work]. With each dropout propose two sets of preferences, one with random assignment up to complete preferences, and one using the implied ordinal preference system up to complete preference. Compare the Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the two proposed preference sets to the actual preference set.
